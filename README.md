# Mars Rover Image Gallery

Select between Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission. This app focuses on utilizing pure functions and iterating over, reshaping, and accessing information from complex API responses.
